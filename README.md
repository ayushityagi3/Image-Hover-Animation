# Image-Hover-Animation

This is a project where I have added image gallery in a website and when you hover over it you see a cool before and after animation on the image. The images have been fit inside a polygon and are arranged in a pattern. First of all download all the files and place them in a separate folder in your computer. Then open the folder through Visual Studio Code app. After that download the 'Live Server' extension from VS Code, if you havent already installed. Then click the 'Go Live' button on the bottom of the app. This will take you to the webpage. Scroll down and you will see images in polygon shaped boxes with text appearing on it. You can hover over any image and see what the animation looks like.
